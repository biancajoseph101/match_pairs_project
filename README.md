### **_Description_**

A card game using HTML, CSS and JavaScript for users to test their animal vocabulary skills and memory skills through matching cards. In order to win, the user must match all of the pairs on the board. There are three levels. Levels two and three are more challenging because the vocabulary is considerably harder and the amount of time that the card is shown is shorter.
