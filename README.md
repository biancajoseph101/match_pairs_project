### **_Description_**

A matching card game with a twist. This game was developed for users to test their animal vocabulary knowledge and memory skills. Rather than matching pairs of cards with the same picture, this game is played by matching cards of pictures of animals to different cards of pictures representing collective names for groups of animals. In order to win, the user must match all of the pairs on the board. There are three levels. Levels two and three are more challenging because the vocabulary is considerably harder and the amount of time that the cards are shown is shorter. If an animal or a collective name is unidentifiable to the user, the answers are revealed at the end so that the user can learn something new.
